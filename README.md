# Churn-Prediction-ANN-Optimized
This project builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classification. It involves data preprocessing, handling class imbalance with SMOTE, and using Dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. The model is trained with ReLU and Sigmoid activations, then evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
